1. Economic Questions and Data
2. Review of Probability

Introduction to R...

## Sampling Probability
    
- Probability
    - Share of population with property
    - Share of random sample - frequency of event
- Population
    - Example: Individuals in Sweden
    - Can be abstract set of states 
        - States of the world where a coin toss gives heads
- Sample
    - Draws of individuals from population
    - Example: Class

## Discrete random variable 

- Finite discrete variable takes $k$ different values
- Age or length of individuals in a class
- Distribution can be characterized by the frequencies:
    - Relative frequency of each age or length
- Expected value:
$$
E[Y] = y_{1}p_{1}+y_{2}p_{2}+ \ldots +y_{n}p_{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}p_{i}
$$
- Average population value if all have the same probability
$$
E[Y] = \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}p_{i} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\frac{1}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}
$$

## Coin toss

- Coin toss has two outcomes (heads or tails)
    - Assign a numerical value to each: -1, 1
    - Equal probability of each outcome with a _fair coin_ 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width==1}
ggplot(tibble(x=c(-1,1), y=1/2), aes(x,y)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    xlab("outcome") + ylab("probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(-1,1))
```

## Discrete random variable - dice

- A toss of a die can have various outcomes
    - Sample space: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Each outcome occurs with equal probability
    - Frequency with which we expect outcome
- _Probability Mass Function (PMF)_ 
    - function that assigns a _probability_ to each outcome in the sample space
    
```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
ggplot(tibble(x=1:6, y=1/6), aes(x,y)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
    xlab("outcome") + ylab("probability") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:6)
```

## Exercise 

- Coin toss has two outcomes (heads or tails)
    - Random variable taking values: -1, 1
    - What is the expected value and variance?

- Consider a random variable that assigns 0, 1 to outcomes
    - What is the expected value and variance?

## Continuous random variable

- Many random variables are best seen as continuous
    - Example: exact position of throwing darts
    - Probability of an exact outcome is zero $Pr(X = 0.5)=0$
- _Probability Density Function (PDF)_ describes probabilities
    - Probability of an outcome is the _area_ under the PDF
    - Probability of $X < 1$ is given by the red area
        - In this case $Pr(X < 1)=1/2$
    
```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.height=3}
dlnorm_shade = function(x) {
    y=dlnorm(x)
    y[x >1] <- NA
    return(y)
}
ggplot(data.frame(X=0:5), aes(X)) +
stat_function(fun=dlnorm_shade, color="red",geom = 'area', fill = 'red', alpha = 0.2) +
stat_function(fun=dlnorm) +
     labs(y = "Density") 
```
    
## Probability and statistics
    
- Random variables
    - Numerical properties of individuals
    - Examples: height, weight and gender
- Characterized by *probability distribution*
    - Probability of each value that variable can take
    - Example: frequencies of all lengths in population
- Summarize with a *statistic*
    - Real or vector valued _function_ of sample
    - Random variable (it depends on a random sample)
    - Sampling distribution of statistic?

## Expected value 

- A *Statistic* summarizes properties of distributions
    - A real valued function of the probability distribution
- If $X$ has a discrete distribution:
    $$E(y)= \sum_i^k y_i p_i=\mu_y$$
- For dice: 
$$E(X)=1*\frac{1}{6}+2*\frac{1}{6}+3*\frac{1}{6}+4*\frac{1}{6}+5*\frac{1}{6}+6*\frac{1}{6}=3.5$$    
- Populations often have equal weights
    - Ex: The mean height of the Swedish population is just the average
    - Sum the weights of everybody and divide by the number of people

## Mean and median of distribution

- _Mean_ - Average $X$ value 
- _Median_ - $X$ with half of the density (area) to the left and right 
    - Differs when distribution is not symmetric (skewed)
    - Example income

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.height=5}
dlnorm_shade = function(x) {
    y=dlnorm(x)
    y[x >1] <- NA
    return(y)
}
ggplot(data.frame(X=0:5), aes(X)) +
stat_function(fun=dlnorm_shade, color="red",geom = 'area', fill = 'red', alpha = 0.2) +
stat_function(fun=dlnorm) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = exp(1/2),
                 color="mean"))+
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1,
                 color="median")) + 
    labs(y = "Density") +
  scale_color_manual(name = "statistics", values = c(median = "red", mean = "blue"))
```

## Some notation 

There is some more or less standard notation used in the book. If $Y$ is a random variable

- $\mu_Y = E(Y)$ - Expected value of $Y$
- $\sigma^2_Y = Var(Y) = E((Y - \mu_Y)^2)$ - Variance of $Y$
- $\sigma_Y = std.dev(Y) = \sqrt{Var(Y)}$ - Standard deviation of $Y$

## Properties of expectations and variance

- Expected value
$$E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$$
$$E(aX) = aE(X)$$
- Variance:
$$Var(aX) = E[(aX-E(aX))^2] = E[(aX-aE(X))^2] = E[a^2(X-E(X))^2]$$
Thus
$$Var(aX) = E[a^2(X-E(X))^2] = a^2E[(X-E(X))^2] = a^2 Var(X)$$

# Statistics programs

## Statistics programs - good / bad:

- Stata - widely used, powerful, well documented / cost
- R - common and free, developing quickly / more difficult
- Gretl - free / limited functionality, small program 
- SPSS - commercial, common in social sciences / menu oriented
- Matlab/Mathematica - for advanced, powerful / costly and difficult
    - Open source alternatives: Python/Julia
- Others: SAS, EViews, Limdep, RATS, ...

## Rstudio

Rstudio like most statistic programs has

- Windows 
  - Many windows, each with tabs 
  - Icons above each window
- Menus 
  - Many menus are for programming
  - Most tasks performed with icons and menus above each window
- Scripting language

## Programming in R {.smaller}

R can be used as a calculator

```{r}
2 + 2
```

Functions can be used:

```{r}
log(2 + 2)
```

R has variables that can be used to store things

```{r}
x <- log(2 + 2)
x
```

## Next lecture

Before next lecture: 

- Do exercises 2.1 - 2.8 (pp 103 - 104)

- Review probability!
- Look at Chapter 3 in textbook
- Look at R and Rstudio
