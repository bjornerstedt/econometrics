## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
2+2
```

The chunk can be executed with the green play button on the right, or with Ctrl-Shift-Enter.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r }
plot(pressure)
```
